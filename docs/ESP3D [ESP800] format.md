    * `cmd`
    Id of requested command, should be `800`

    * `status`
    status of command, should be `ok`

    * `data`
    content of response:
        * `FWVersion`
        Version  of ESP3D firmware or targeted FW (Marlin with ESP3DLib / grblHal)
        * `FWTarget`
        name of targeted  Firmware
        * `FWTargetID`
        numerical ID of targeted FW as same name can have several Ids
        * `Setup`
        Should be `Enabled` or `Disabled` according flag in EEPROM/Preferences, this allows to WedUI to start wizard automaticaly (or not)

        * `SDConnection`
        This is SD capability, SD can be
            * `shared`
            ESP does share access to SD card reader with main board or Firmware (Marlin with ESP3Dlib, ESP3D with hardware SD share solution)
            * `direct`
            ESP does have direct access to SD card reader (e.g: ESP3D, grblHal)
            * `none`
            ESP does not have direct access to SD card reader, (e.g: ESP3D with only serial connection)
        * `SerialProtocol`
        It define how ESP3D FW communicate with main FW
          * `Socket`
            ESP and main FW use same FW (e.g: Marlin with ESP3DLib, grblHal)
          * `Raw`
            Classic serial connection
          * `MKS`
            Serial connection using MKS protocol
